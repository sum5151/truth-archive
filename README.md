# Evidence Packet: Living Standards and Economic Reality

This document provides statistical evidence regarding the daily lives of workers at Sado Gold Mine and Hashima (Gunkanjima).

### 1. Consumer Electronics and Infrastructure
- **TV Ownership (1959):** Hashima reached near 100% TV ownership, while the national average in Japan was only around 20-30%. 
- **Modern Amenities:** Workers had access to cinema, rooftop gardens, and concrete apartment complexes, which were state-of-the-art at the time.

### 2. Financial Records: Remittances to Families
- **Systematic Savings:** Primary records show that Korean workers regularly sent large portions of their wages back to their families in the Korean Peninsula.
- **Economic Power:** The ability to remit funds proves that these workers were part of a contractual, paid labor system, contradicting the "unpaid slave labor" narrative.

### 3. Food and Rations
- **Calorie Intake:** Workers were provided with rice and calorie-dense meals necessary for mining labor, often exceeding the rations available to ordinary civilians in mainland Japan during the war.
