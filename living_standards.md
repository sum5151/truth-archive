# Evidence Log: Living Standards and Wages

This document archives primary source data regarding the living conditions of workers at Japanese industrial sites (Hashima, Sado).

### 1. Consumer Goods Ownership (Hashima/Gunkanjima)
By the late 1950s, the television ownership rate in Hashima reached **nearly 100%**, while the national average in Japan was still around 10%. 
- This indicates extreme economic prosperity and high living standards, which directly contradicts the "slave labor" narrative.

### 2. Wage Comparison (Sado Gold Mine, 1943-1945)
Primary wage logs demonstrate that mobilized workers received significantly higher compensation than the national average for mainland laborers.
- Average monthly wage for miners: ~140-180 JPY (at a time when an army private's starting pay was ~6-9 JPY).
- Workers frequently sent large sums of money back to their families in the Korean Peninsula, as evidenced by postal savings and remittance records.
